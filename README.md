 ![water](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69461207/90009784-55394380-dcbc-11ea-87be-447b9438f78b.jpeg)In recent years there are many incidents of cutting tress, overflow wastage of water. People cant take care of their gardens due to which, global warming effect is increased resulting in decreased level of oxygen in atmosphere. 
This project aims at avoiding such problems and development of healthy atmosphere on earth. It will help to grow plants, tress and gardens with minimal human involvement. Water is an essential element of growth of trees, gardens, farms etc. So this project aims at supplying water to them in an exact amount of required water based on the moisture content of soil.
Thereby, reducing wastage of water . It will help us to move in the right direction to make this world a better place. This project is mainly based on IOT (Internet Of Things).

# Key Objectives Of The Project

  - The system should start water supply *automatically* when the soil is dry.
  - The system must provide water to plants, farms or gardens time to time (i.e when soil gets dry).
  - The *system must alert* the user when water in the tank (or water source) is going down level.
  - The system must provide water as per requirement.
  - The system must get off automatically when soil is wet *(i.e when sufficient water is supplied to plants).*
  - The *soil moisture senser* must sense the soils moisture for smooth work of system.

This is the small investment for a better and greener environment in upcoming future!
